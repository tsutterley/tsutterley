### Hi, I'm Tyler &#128075;

I'm a Research Associate at the UW APL Polar Science Center

I use &#9992;&#65039; and &#128752;&#65039; data to see our planet's glaciers change

I am typically writing code in Python and making terrible jokes on Slack

Ask me about NASA [Operation IceBridge](https://icebridge.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/) or [GRACE-FO](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/grace-fo)!
